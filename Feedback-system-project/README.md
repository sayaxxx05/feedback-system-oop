# Feedback-system-project

1. Title:  Feedback System 
2. Description: The goal of the project is to develop a feedback system that will allow users to leave feedback on products, services or other facilities, and administrators or owners to analyze these reviews. The project should be structured using the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.
3. Project Requirements List: 

1)User Registration and Authentication
- Allow users to sign up with unique credentials (e.g., username and password). 
- Implement login and logout functionality. 

2)Role-Based Access Control
- Distinguish between regular users and administrators. 
- Restrict certain actions (e.g., deleting reviews) to administrators. 

3)Object Management
- Enable administrators to add, update, view, and delete objects (e.g., products or services) for which feedback can be collected. 

4)Feedback Submission
- Allow users to leave feedback for specific objects. 
- Include both a numeric rating (e.g., 1-5 stars) and a text comment. 

5)Feedback Modification
- Let users edit or delete their own feedback. 

6)Feedback Moderation
- Provide administrators with tools to view and remove inappropriate or irrelevant feedback. 

7)Sorting and Filtering
- Allow users to sort feedback by date, rating, or popularity. 
- Implement filters to display feedback for a specific object or within a date range. 

8)Analytics and Reports
- Calculate and display the average rating for each object. 
- Generate reports summarizing the number of reviews, average ratings, and trends over time. 

9)Data Persistence
- Save all data (users, objects, feedback) in a persistent storage solution (e.g., text files, XML, or a database like SQLite). 
- Load data automatically when the system starts. 

10)User Interface (UI)
- Create a user-friendly console-based or graphical interface (using JavaFX). 
- Provide separate menus for users and administrators with intuitive navigation.
